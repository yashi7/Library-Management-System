# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of cultivating an open and inclusive environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to ensuring that participation in our project and community is a harassment-free experience for everyone. We embrace diversity and do not tolerate discrimination based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive behavior that contributes to a harmonious environment includes:

- Respecting and embracing diverse viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community.
- Demonstrating empathy towards fellow community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome attention or advances.
- Trolling, making insulting/derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are tasked with clarifying acceptable behavior standards and are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Temporary or permanent banning of contributors may occur for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by contacting [yashi.s@msds.christuniversity.in](mailto:yashi.s@msds.christuniversity.in). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately for further details.

Project maintainers not following or enforcing the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
